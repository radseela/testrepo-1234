Prerequisites
Step 1: Update your CentOS 7 system
Step 2: Install Java
Step 3: Install Jenkins
===========================================
Step 1: Update your CentOS 7 system
One of the Linux system administrator's best practices is keeping a system up to date. Install the latest stable packages, then reboot.

#sudo yum install epel-release
#sudo yum update
#sudo reboot
When the reboot finishes, login with the same sudo user.

Step 2: Install Java

Before you can install Jenkins, you need to setup a Java virtual machine on your system. Here, let's install the latest OpenJDK Runtime Environment 1.8.0 using YUM:

#sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64

After the installation, you can confirm it by running the following command:

java -version
This command will tell you about the Java runtime environment that you have installed:

openjdk version "1.8.0_91"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_91-b14)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.91-b14, mixed mode)
In order to help Java-based applications locate the Java virtual machine properly, you need to set two environment variables: "JAVA_HOME" and "JRE_HOME".

sudo cp /etc/profile /etc/profile_backup
echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
echo 'export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
source /etc/profile
Finally, you can print them for review:

echo $JAVA_HOME
echo $JRE_HOME

Step 3: Install Jenkins

Use the official YUM repo to install the latest stable version of Jenkins, which is 1.651.2 at the time of writing:

#cd ~ 
$sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
$sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
$yum install jenkins
Start the Jenkins service and set it to run at boot time:

$sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
$sudo systemctl enable jenkins.service

In order to allow visitors access to Jenkins, you need to allow inbound traffic on port 8080:

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Now, test Jenkins by visiting the following address from your web browser:

http://<your-Vultr-server-IP>:8080

WAR file
The Web application ARchive (WAR) file version of Jenkins can be installed on any operating system or platform that supports Java.

To download and run the WAR file version of Jenkins:

Download the latest stable Jenkins WAR file to an appropriate directory on your machine.

Open up a terminal/command prompt window to the download directory.

Run the command java -jar jenkins.war.

Browse to http://localhost:8080 and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.
